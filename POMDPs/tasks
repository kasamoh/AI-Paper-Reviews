Your task is to organise a discussion around the paper. Work out a set of
topics and questions to take up in sequence. Since you can see the
students'
responses before the presentation, feel free to pick out individual
comments and ask the concerned student to elaborate. Of course, you are
most welcome to write directly to the class to inform them of the plan for
the discussion beforehand. Plan for 75 minutes. You can use the board
and/or use slides to illustrate key concepts (but don't make more than 3-4
slides).
